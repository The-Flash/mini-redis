# Mini Redis

Mini Redis is a lightweight, in-memory key-value store inspired by Redis. It supports basic operations such as setting, getting, and deleting keys, as well as simple data structures like strings and hashes.


This is a learning project and is not intended for production use.

It is based on https://github.com/tokio-rs/mini-redis
